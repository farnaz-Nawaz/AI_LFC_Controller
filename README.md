# AI_LFC_Controller
AI_LFC_Controller uses AI and PID methods to stabilize power system frequency under load changes. It trains an ANN to predict frequency deviations and compares its performance with a traditional PID controller, showing smoother and more adaptive control.
📊 Results
The ANN controller reacts faster, gives smoother output, and reduces frequency deviation better than the PID controller, especially during sudden load changes.
